            <h3 id="LibraryCirculation">Library Circulation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All patrons must present either a current MICA ID, a current BALC member institution ID or Decker Library alumni card in order to borrow materials.</li>
              <li>Books are borrowed for a period of three weeks for students and staff, one semester for faculty.</li>
              <li>DVDs are borrowed for a period of two days for students, two weeks for faculty and staff.</li>
              <li>If an item that you need is on loan to another patron, you may ask Circulation staff to place it on hold, and notify you when it is returned.</li>
              <li>Any item may be renewed if no other patron has placed a hold on it - see student guidelines for more information.</li>
              <li>Overdue charges are $0.25 a day per book, $1.00 a day per DVD.</li>
              <li>A book is considered lost if not returned within two months of the due date. A DVD is considered lost if not returned within two weeks of the due date. The borrower is then charged the item's full replacement cost along with a $25 processing fee per item.</li>
              <li>Items can be returned after hours through the drop located at the main entrance of the Library on the first floor of the Bunting Center.</li>
              <li>Users can view a list of their checked-out items — and students may renew items twice — using the Library Catalog by clicking on "My Account" and logging in with their MICA credentials.</li>
              <li>You can also view your account using your mobile device! The free BookMyne app allows you to view your checked-out items, holds and fines, and allows students to renew items. Available in the App Store for Apple iOS and Google Play for Android.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="LibraryFacilities">Library Facilities</h3>
            <p>The Library has two main public areas. The first floor features the Circulation Desk with Reserves, current periodicals, new book displays, and circulating videos. The lower available for wheelchair access. Please ask a staff member for assistance with the elevator.</p>
            <h3 id="Policies">Policies</h3>

            <p>If you need digital images for a MICA-related professional presentation that are not available through the catalog or on ARTstor, you may order them through the library. Please allow at least two weeks for processing and longer for larger orders. Please provide all source materials for the images that you require.</p>
            <p>Please contact our Media Coordinator, <a href="mailto:asoontornsaratool@mica.edu">Art Soontornsaratool </a>with any questions.</p>
            <h3 id="InterlibraryLoans">Interlibrary Loans</h3>
            <p>If a book, article, film/video, or other item is not in the Decker Library, we can usually arrange to borrow a copy from elsewhere. The Interlibrary loan service is done online, with most materials available in 1-2 weeks. Occasionally, the lending library charges for the service. In this case, you will be notified of the charges before the book is ordered.</p>
            <p>Interlibrary Loan requests can be made as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>On-line with these request forms:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/mica.edu/forms/d/1dSCVEZN1b0HUgWQBMSNZkMuOq8IXaoP58aIDJwGbss8/viewform">Book Request</a></li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>The request forms are also available within the <a href="http://ezproxy.mica.edu:2048/login?url=http://mica.sdp.sirsi.net/client/auth" title="link to catalog"              target="_blank">Library Catalog</a></li>
              <li>By email to the Interlibrary Loan staff at <a href="mailto:ill@mica.edu">ill@mica.edu</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students will be notified via email to pick up books or articles at the Circulation Desk once they are received, and are required to return items to a staff person at the Circulation Desk. Please do not return Interlibrary Loan materials in the book drop.</p>
            <p>Faculty will be notified via their mica.edu email to pick the materials up at the Circulation Desk once they are received. All patrons are required to return the materials to a staff person at the Circulation Desk. Please do not use the book drop to return Interlibrary Loan materials. Material borrowed from other libraries may not be placed on reserve.</p>
            <p>Interlibrary loan service is not available to MICA alumni through the Decker Library. However, please note that most public libraries will provide Interlibrary Loan service to their registered patrons. This is true of Baltimore's <a href="http://www.epfl.net/about/index.aspx?id=2906" target="_blank">Enoch Pratt Free Library</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.bcpl.info/libpg/lib_catalog.html#directloan" target="_blank">Baltimore County Public Library</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.library.jhu.edu" title="Link to JHU Library" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a> - Johns Hopkins University extends borrowing privileges to MICA <b>faculty and graduate and post-bac students only</b>. Interested MICA people must first visit the Decker Library Circulation desk to have a registration form completed by Circulation staff to take to the JHU Library. The privilege applies only to the Eisenhower Library on the Homewood Campus.</p>
            <p>One can enter the Eisenhower Library by presenting a photo ID card between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. After 8 p.m., one must show an academic ID (i.e., a MICA ID).</p>
            <p>Computer use within seated computer labs at the Eisenhower Library is restricted to those with borrowing privileges and requires registration at their Circulation Desk between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Stand-up computers throughout the library are available for use by all visitors, and contain the same resources as the seated computers.</p>
            <p><em>NOTE: JHU limits access to the library during their mid-term and final exam periods. This includes a "reading week" prior to their final exam week. During those times, visitors can only use the library from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. During all other times, a valid JHU ID is required for entrance. <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/registrar/calendar.html" title="Link to JHU Academic Calendar" target="_blank">See the JHU Academic Calendar</a>. </em></p>
